- Broke query logging (it no longer logs queries).
- Broke querying of feeds.
- post-processors have been removed.

- Probably broke hash lookups.
  + Turns out I didn't.

- Database inserts are NOT optimal, at the moment. Commits are being
  performed between each insert.

Places that still have IODEF / Protocol Buffers:
- libcif-dbi/lib/CIF/Archive/Plugin/* 
  - I wanted to knock out the protocol abstraction prior to rolling back all
  the iodef stuff in the archive plugins.
- libcif/lib/CIF/Client*
- libcif/bin/cif - Relies upon Iodef::Simple::format to format output. ugh.
